Building pipeline:
1.create git repo and then clone to local repo
2.add src folder along with all components(run them individually)
3.add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore file
4.src folder > data_ingestion.py > data_preprocessing.py > feature_engineering.py > model_building.py > model_evaluation.py
5. after adding all the components
6. In the .gitignore file add data, models, reports folders(because we will use dvc for tracking them)
7.git add.commit and push the remaining code

================================================================
Automate the steps using dvc
1. first initialize dvc "dvc init"
2. then make a "dvc.yaml" file which is used to automate
3. to run the yaml file use "dvc repro"
4. for visualizing the stages use "dvc dag"
5. "dvc.lock file will be created and the id's in it can be used for further"
6. push changes in code to the github
